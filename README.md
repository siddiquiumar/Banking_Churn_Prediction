# Banking Customer Churn Prediction

This project predicts whether a bank customer is likely to churn (leave the bank) based on their demographic and account information. It uses **machine learning** techniques to analyze patterns and identify at-risk customers. Furthermore, this project also dives into figuring out which type of model would work with which type of business use case.
